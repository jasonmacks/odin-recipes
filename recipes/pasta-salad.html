    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This tri-colored pasta salad with broccoli, cauliflower, pepperoni,
      cheese, and spices is out of this world. Great to take to a BBQ on those
      warm summer nights. This salad tastes wonderful right after you make it
      but is best served the day after.
